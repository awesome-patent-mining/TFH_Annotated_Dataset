## **Dataset Introduction**
TFH_Annotated_Dataset is an annotated patent dataset pertaining to *thin film head* technology in hard-disk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first labeled patent dataset public available in technology management domain that annotates both entities and the semantic relations between entities. 

The well-crafted information schema used for patent annotation contains 17 types of entities and 15 types of semantic relations as shown below.

There are 1010 patent abstracts with 3,996 sentences in this corpus . We use a web-based annotation tool named *Brat*[1] for data labeling, and the annotated data is saved in '.ann' format. The benefit of 'ann' is that you can display and manipulate the annotated data once TFH_Annotated_Dataset.zip is unzipped in the corresponding repository of Brat, here we provide a demo as shown in Fig. 1.

## **Information extraction results with deep learning models**
With TFH_Annotated_Dataset, we run two tasks of information extraction including named entity recognition  with BiLSTM-CRF[2] and semantic relation extractionand with BiGRU-2ATTENTION[3]. For improving semantic representation of patent language, the word embeddings are trained with the abstract of 46,302 patents regarding magnetic head in hard disk drive, which  turn out to improve the performance of  named entity recognition by 0.3% and semantic relation extraction by about 2% in weighted average F1, compared to GloVe and the patent word embedding provided by Risch et al[4].

For named entity recognition, the weighted-average precision, recall, F1-value of BiLSTM-CRF on entity-level for the test set are 78.5%, 78.0%, and 78.2%, respectively. Although such performance is acceptable, it is still lower than its performance on general-purpose dataset by more than 10% in F1-value. The main reason is the limited amount of labeled dataset. 

The precision, recall, and F1-value for each type of entity is shown in Fig. 4.

**Fig.4** Result of BiLSTM-CRF for named entity recognition.

As to relation extraction,  the weighted-average precision, recall, F1-value of BiGRU-2ATTENTION for the test set are 78.5%, 78.0%, and 78.2% with no_edge relations, and 32.3%, 41.5%, 36.3% without no_edge relations. 

The precision, recall, and F1-value for each type of relation is shown in Fig. 5.
